## What is GrayCocoding.jl?

[GrayCoding](https://github.com/nivupai/GrayCoding.jl) is a formal Linear Algebraic framework for ``q``-ry Gray Code.
Encoding and Decooding of Gray codes can be treated as a special case of algebraic block coding.

* Encoding: ``g=G*b ``
* Decoding: ``b=B*g ``

    This is still under active devlopment.
